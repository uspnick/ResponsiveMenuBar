# ResponsiveMenuBar
This package is a responsive and customizable template for a single page application (SPA) that features a menu bar and an iframe to display content. The menu bar is responsive, and if there are too many menu items to fit on the screen, the excess items are hidden and displayed in a dropdown menu accessed by clicking on the "hamburger" icon.
