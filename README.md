# ResponsiveMenuBar

This package was created with the active participation of ChatGPT. I provided the specs and after generating the HTML, CSS, JS by ChatGPT, I was fixing the issues and sending back an updated version to ChatGPT to get comments. This cycle was then repeated until it was done. At the final stage, ChatGPT suggested how to rename all objects in the code, including styles, variables, functions, and then ChatGPT created the description below.

## Customization.

The ResponsiveMenuBar package is highly customizable. You can change the colors, fonts, and other styles in the CSS code to match your website's design. You can also add or remove links from the menu bar by editing the HTML code.

If you want to modify the JavaScript code, make sure to have a good understanding of JavaScript before doing so. The code is heavily commented, but it can be complex for beginners.
